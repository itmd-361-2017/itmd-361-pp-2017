        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Bryant McGee. I'm a transfer student from Truman College and this is my 3rd semester here at IIT.
          Im currently enrolled in the ITM program and i plan on specializing in IT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT.
          Outside of school, i co-operate a clothing boutique with my friend. It's a store based on the south side of Chicago.
          I also have my own photography business where i cover events, do portraits, etc. I love sports, learning about new tech, art,
          and anything creative.
